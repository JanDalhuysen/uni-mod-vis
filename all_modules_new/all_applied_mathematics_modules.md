## Fourth Year

### 476 (16) Numerical Methods (3L)

The module focuses on numerical methods for matrix computations. We look at the effective solution of
square linear systems, least-squares problems, and the eigenvalue problem. We consider direct as well as
iterative methods, with special attention to sparse matrices and structured matrices. Pitfalls such as
numerical instability and ill-conditioning are pointed out. Model problems are drawn from partial differential
equations and image processing. Theory, algorithmic aspects and applications are emphasised in equal

measure.

### 482 (16) Graph Theory (3L)

This module serves as a broad introduction to the field of graph theory by exposing students to a number of
important problems and subfields of the discipline, such as optimal paths in networks, optimal spanning
trees, planarity, vertex and edge colouring, Eulerian graphs and Hamiltonicity, tournaments, domination and
independence, and Ramsey theory. Although this module focuses on the theoretical aspects of these
concepts, the applications thereof include optimal route planning and production scheduling, planning of
communication network infrastructure, the construction of timetables, placement of facilities in networks,
vehicle problems, and the travelling salesperson problem.

### 483 (16) Applied Markov Processes (3L)

This module gives an introduction to Markov processes, focusing on their application for modelling



dynamical systems perturbed by noise or manmade systems in which randomness or uncertainties play an
important role. The theory covers Markov chains in discrete and continuous time, random walks, Brownian
motion, stochastic differential equations, and stochastic calculus. Applications include population dynamics,
queues, particle systems, diffusions, noise-perturbed dynamical systems, stochastic control, and finance.
The module also has tutorials on simulation methods (in MATLAB or Python).

### 492 (16) Computer Vision

The first part of the module covers the basics of image processing, feature detection and matching, projective geometry, perspective transformations, robust model estimation with RANSAC, the pinhole camera
model, and stereo vision for depth estimation. The second part focuses on deep neural networks, and specifically convolutional neural networks for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
Relevant machine learning concepts, including training by stochastic gradient descent, are also introduced.

### 493 (16) Digital Image Processing

Basic greyscale transformations and image enhancement techniques in the spatial domain; Fourier analysis
in two dimensions and image enhancement techniques in the Fourier domain; image restoration;
morphological filters; image compression techniques; image segmentation, representation, description and
recognition.

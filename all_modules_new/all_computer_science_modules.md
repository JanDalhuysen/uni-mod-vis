domains and for implementing deterministic classical planning algorithms. The module progresses to
probabilistic techniques, covering some probabilistic graphical models for reasoning over time, and Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) for probabilistic planning. Boolean and Arithmetic Circuits are covered - these are
used for compact representation and tractable reasoning with Boolean and arithmetic/probabilistic
knowledge. Students will learn a probabilistic logic programming language and will be expected to
implement programs for solving complex problems involving uncertainty. The module concludes with

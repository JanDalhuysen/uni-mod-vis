# 13622 Environmental Field Skills

## Second Year

### 271 (8) Environmental Field Skills (2P)

A compulsory module for students taking the Geo-environmental Science focal area of the Earth Science
Programme. The module is composed of eight days’ compulsory field work spread over one year. Field work
will cover the following aspects of environmental field skills: Collection and preservation of water samples,
appropriate sampling methodologies, measuring physical and geochemical properties of water in the field;
practical use of environmental geochemistry to understand interactions between different water bodies and
the impact of human activities on the quantity and quality of water in these bodies; practical understanding
of the role of geomorphology on controlling water movement, recharge and discharge processes; practical
understanding of the role of soils in controlling groundwater compositions and storage.

**Prerequisite modules:**
- Geo-environmental Science 124, 154
- Chemistry 124 or 164; and 154

**Corequisite modules:**
- Environmental Geochemistry 214
- Geology 244

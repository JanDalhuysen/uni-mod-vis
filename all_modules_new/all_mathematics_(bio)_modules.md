### 176 (32) Introductory Mathematics for the Biological Sciences (3L, 3P)

For students in the BSc (extended curriculum programmes).

Any student who wishes to take this module must have achieved a mark of at least 4 (or 50%) for
Mathematics on the NSC or the IEB school-leaving certificate.

Different presentations of functions in terms of formulas, graphs, tables and stories; inverse of a function;
exponential and logarithmic functions; trigonometric functions and their inverse functions; modelling with
functions; gradual progression from average to instantaneous rate of change; limits. Simple two-dimensional
Euclidean geometry, as applied to polygons and circles; co-ordinate geometry; linear programming: optimising a function in two variables subject to linear constraints; introduction to data handling and probability.

# 63991 Environmental Geochemistry

## Second Year

### 214 (16) Introduction to Environmental Geochemistry (3L, 3P)

The natural geochemical cycles of elements at the surface of the Earth, as well as effects of human activities
upon these cycles; the distribution and transport of chemical substances between the atmospheric,
continental and marine environments; interactions between chemical, geological, physical and biological
environmental processes; analysis of environmental geochemical data (geochemical modelling techniques
and methods).

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Geo-environmental Science 154

**Prerequisite modules:**
- Geo-environmental Science 124
- Chemistry 124 or 164; and 144

## Third Year

### 314 (16) Environmental Geochemistry (3L, 3P)

geochemistry. Surface complexation reactions; contaminants in soils; chemical evolution of surface and
subsurface water; wastewater evolution; contaminant transport processes and reactions; geomaterials and
human health; sampling and monitoring of air, soils and water; a brief introduction to physics and chemistry

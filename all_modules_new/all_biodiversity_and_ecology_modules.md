## Second Year

### 212 (16) Statistics and Other Tools for Biologists (3L, 3P)

This module is a thorough introduction to the key numerical skills and processes underpinning the good
practice of biological sciences. It covers experimental design, statistical analyses, the concept of null and
alternative hypotheses, data handling and logical interpretation, data presentation and scientific
communication, advanced use of Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint and R Statistical Computing free software.
Hands-on statistical exercises cover a range of descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric
analyses, basic data manipulation, plots, linear regression and analysis of variance. Applied scientific
investigatory principles to biology are explored using experimental planning (controls, replication,
randomisation), ethics, scientific and popular publication processes, and the use of scientific literature.

**Corequisite modules:**
- Science in Context 178 or Computer Skills 171

### 214 (16) Principles of Ecology (3L, 3P)

The basics of aquatic biology and population ecology are taught by integrating theory and practical field
work. Topics will focus on population growth and life history strategies used by organisms to maximise
fitness. This module will be closely integrated with Biodiversity and Ecology 212 in which students will be
taught how to analyse ecological data. There will be a three-day, compulsory field course in which students
conduct their own research projects.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biology 124 or 144 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biology module

**Corequisite modules:**
- Biodiversity and Ecology 212 or an equivalent statistical module

### 224 (16) Diversity and Function of Invertebrates (3L, 3P)

The focus of this module is invertebrate diversity. Major adaptations in morphology (form) and recent
molecular changes in taxonomy, as well as physiological adaptations within the major phyla will be explored.
Topics will include: recent developments in phylogenetic classifications within the major groups;
physiological challenges, such as those related to respiration, osmoregulation, feeding, locomotion, defence,
sensory perception and reproduction, which invertebrates face in their respective environments (marine,
freshwater and terrestrial); and what strategies are used to cope with or compensate for these challenges.
The practical component of the module will entail laboratory work.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biology 144 or 154 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biology module

### 244 (16) Principles of Evolution (3L, 3P)

The principal evolutionary mechanisms which shape the biological world will be dealt with. It provides a
historical perspective on the development of the major ideas in evolutionary thinking and tackles the
interface between evolutionary research and the public's perception of it. Topics covered include theoretical
genetic models which underlie modern molecular genetic approaches, natural selection and how it
operates, the distinctions and links between micro- and macroevolution and how species are formed and
lost. In addition to theoretical understanding, students will be exposed to the design and execution of
experiments in evolution.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biology 124 or 144 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biology module

### 254 (16) Vertebrate Life (3L, 3P)

The module deals with various aspects of vertebrates: where they originated, present diversity, how they
evolved, what they do and how they work. Topics covered include: characteristic features of vertebrates and



their body plans; the broad pattern of the evolutionary relationships of vertebrates; ontogeny of vertebrates
and the evolutionary implications of developmental mechanisms; basic anatomy, physiology and evolution
of vertebrate organ systems; reproductive biology and strategies: sex determination; hormonal control;
seasonal cycles; evolution of viviparity; thermo-energetics; water balance, osmoregulation and excretion;
surviving in extreme environments. This module includes seminars and practical sessions with data collected
in the laboratory or in the field excursion.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biology 144 or 154 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biology module

### 264 (16) Diversity of Plant Form and Function (3L, 3P)

Plants occupy the most diverse habitats on earth. A wide range of morphological and physiological
adaptations are required to conquer these habitats. The diversity of plant form and function will be explored
as interlinked themes to understand how plants grow, respond to natural cycles, capture resources and
survive in adverse conditions. The theory and practicals will explore each theme in a complementary way
that will include formal lectures, group discussions, laboratory and field experiments.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biology 144 or 154 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biology module

## Third Year

### 311 (16) Climate and Global Change Challenges (3L, 3P)

The study of global change with a biological perspective brings together historical and current evidence for
such changes and summarises its main drivers. Topics include global climate change, anthropogenic drivers
such as pollution, invasion biology, land use and ecosystem change. Data at different spatial and temporal
scales and at different levels of biological organisation are covered (from species to communities and
ecosystems, and from micro to macroscales), highlighting the technologies and numerical techniques used
to study these processes. Examples will have a strong African focus, including case studies from the
Western Cape province from both faunal and floral perspectives. Important areas of teaching include the
relevance of understanding global climate change for African, in particular South African, ecosystems. There
is a strong emphasis on appropriate communication regarding all the above topics, both among scientists
and between scientists and other stakeholders, including the general public.

### 315 (16) Ecology Field Course (3L, 3P)

This is a field-based module. The location of the module will change from year to year. The module will be
timed to fall outside of the formal lecture periods – typically during the last two weeks of January. The aim of
the module is to bring ecological and evolutionary theory to life in the field. The main foci are biotic
interactions (e.g. pollination, competition, facilitation), animal behaviour and ecosystem-level ecology.
Lectures, assignments and discussion groups will be conducted in the field, as well as during the normal
university term.

This module is a restricted module and largely limited to students registered in the Biodiversity and Ecology
programme. Participants may be selected from other programmes based on past performance and available
places.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biodiversity and Ecology 212 or 214 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biodiversity and
_Ecology module_

### 324 (16) Angiosperm Diversity and Evolution (3L, 3P)

The theory investigates the origin and phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms, as determined
through different classification systems. Angiosperm diversification and classification is studied through the
use of morphological, anatomical, embryological, palynological and molecular characters. The role of
hybridisation and polyploidy in the diversification of the angiosperm lineage is assessed. Specialised
morphological and physiological adaptations to suboptimal environments and the effect of such adaptations
on the diversification of angiosperms are discussed.

The practical series focuses on Fynbos taxa and plant identification up to the family level.

_Prerequisite pass modules: ‒ any two of the following three modules:_
- Biology 124,144,154

### 341 (16) Climate and Global Change Solutions (3L, 3P)

This module builds on Global Change 311 (Global Change Challenges). It will expose students to the
concepts of adaptation and mitigation of global and climate change, providing them with a variety of tools to
develop solutions to the challenges of global change. Topics include the concepts of resilience and
resistance from both a biological and a human perspective, spatial planning for biodiversity (with a focus on
how conservation outcomes may change with changing climates and species responses), conservation
genetics as a tool to support spatial planning and species conservation (including adaptive responses to
environmental stressors), carbon storage and trading and their links to ecological restoration (with a focus on
blue carbon ecosystems), managing invasive species at national as well as international level, restoration



ecology, and policy and legislation to support conservation and management outcomes.

_Global Change 311 is not a prerequisite for Global Change 341 (especially for international students). However, it_
_is highly recommended that students do take Global Change 311, because an understanding of the_
_fundamentals of the drivers of climate change and their impact on biodiversity and well-being (which are_
_covered in Global Change 311) will prepare students for the content of Global Change 341 and provide a stronger_
_footing from which to start. Global Change 341 can be taken independently, if necessary, but this will require_
_additional, independent work by students for them to be able to follow the content of the module._

### 342 (16) Integrative Marine Science (3L, 3P)

This module is presented as five sections that progress from understanding the physical, chemical,
geological and biological nature of marine systems to the utilisation, management and protection of marine
products systems. Exploration of the physical marine environment focusses specifically on ocean climate
and circulation, tides and waves, and coastal and estuarine processes. This is followed by the chemical
section, which examines the properties of seawater, focussing on salinity and dissolved gases. The
geological section considers plate tectonics, marine provinces and marine sediments. The biological section
explores biological life in oceans and adaptations of marine organisms to the different marine environments;
productivity and how this feeds into energy and food webs; and benthic, pelagic, island, estuarine and
mangrove systems. The final section explores the historical and contemporary reliance of humans on the
ocean; consequences of harvesting marine products; the development of marine protected areas and how
this often leads to conflict with people who rely on the ocean for their livelihoods or recreation. Throughout
the module we will explore skills related to understanding and measuring different processes.

### 344 (16) Evolutionary Ecology (3L, 3P)

Topical themes in evolutionary ecology will be covered, namely the evolution of behaviour, biotic
interactions and physiology. This module will deal with the following, as well as related, topics: game theory;
optimal-foraging theory; life history evolution; evolution of sex; sexual selection and sex ratios; altruism and
the evolution of sociality. Evolutionary arms races with mimicry and sexual conflict as examples; coevolution
of plant animal interactions. The link between behaviour and physiology and physiological tolerances and
constraints on survival, life histories and reproductive strategies. Appropriate field and statistical techniques
used in evolutionary ecology research will be covered during practical sessions.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biodiversity and Ecology 212 or 214 and a final mark of at least 40% in the other Biodiversity and
_Ecology module_

**Corequisite modules:**
- Biodiversity and Ecology 244

### 354 (16) Evolutionary Patterns and Processes (3L, 3P)

Evolutionary theory underpins all of modern biology and is used and applied to generate hypotheses
pertinent to the understanding of biodiversity and ecology. By adopting a multi-level approach, the module
focus on the following topics: Time tree of life, evolutionary biogeography, genetic diversity and
differentiation among populations, gene flow, terrestrial and marine phylogeography, reconstruction of a
phylogeny, gene trees/species trees, coalescent, rates of evolution, taxonomy, evolutionary classification,
conservation genetics, molecular ecology, invasion genetics, genome evolution, cytogenetics/chromosomal
evolution, evolutionary development.

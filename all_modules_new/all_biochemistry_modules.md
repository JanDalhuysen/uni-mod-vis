## Second Year

### 214 (16) Biomolecules: Structure-function Relationships (3L, 3P)

Introduction to the living cell, bio-elements, and the importance of water as the solvent for biochemical
reactions and its role in living systems. Introduction to biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates,
and lipids): their structures, functions and characteristics. An introduction to protein ligand binding, enzyme
catalysis and enzyme kinetics.



The practical component covers basic laboratory skills, e.g. how to weigh, how to prepare a solution,
dilutions, the use of a micro pipette, the use of a pH meter and a spectrophotometer. Students will
investigate the principles of buffering and how to determine an unknown concentration using a standard

curve.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Chemistry 124 or 164, 144
- Biology 124

### 244 (16) Intermediary Metabolism (3L, 3P)

Bioenergetics of metabolism, the metabolism of biomolecules (carbohydrates, lipids and some nitrogen
containing compounds). Glycolysis, citric acid cycle and glyoxylate cycle. Oxidative phosphorylation.
Photosynthesis. Regulation and integration of metabolism: exploring the implications of metabolic
abnormalities in different biological systems.

The practical component includes enzymatic assays, enzyme kinetics, the role of effectors on enzyme
activity and the basic principles of chromatography.

**Prerequisite modules:**
- Biochemistry 214

## Third Year

### 315 (16) Biophysical and Structural Protein Biochemistry (3L, 3T)

Biophysical analysis: quantitative, qualitative and structural analysis of biological molecules, with focus on
amino acids, peptides and proteins, utilising techniques such as spectrophotometry, fluorescence, mass
spectrometry, gel electrophoresis and chromatography.

Advanced protein biochemistry: Protein purification techniques and analysis of protein purity, composition
and structure. Protein structure/function relationships are studied in the context of a number of specialised
complex protein systems and enzymatic reaction mechanisms.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biochemistry 214, 244
- Mathematics (Bio)124 or Mathematics 114

### 323 (8) Systems Biology (3L, 3T/3P)

Thermodynamics and kinetics of biochemical processes; enzyme kinetics; kinetics of membrane transport
processes; kinetics of coupled-reaction systems; metabolic control analysis; supply-demand analysis of
metabolic regulation; mathematical modelling; types of models; modelling with differential equations;
examples of models.

Theoretical concepts are applied in tutorial sessions and computer practicals.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Biochemistry 214, 244
- Mathematics (Bio) 124 or Mathematics 114

### 345 (16) Specialised Biochemical Topics (3L, 3T)

Selected topics chosen from the following (two of the following three topics are selected for presentation
every year):

Antibiotics: The biochemistry of selected antibiotics and antimicrobial agents.

Intracellular signal transduction pathways integrated with eucaryotic gene expression: ligand-activated
receptor signalling; receptor binding theory; cell surface receptors; nuclear receptors; protein-protein
interactions; signalling networks and cross talk; regulation of gene expression; chromatin remodelling;
promoters and enhancers; transcription factors.

Immunology: Innate and specific acquired immunity; antibody structure and function; defence mechanisms
against pathogenic organisms; vaccinations; allergies; immune disorders; differential gene expression in
lymphocyte development and immune diagnostic techniques.

**Prerequisite modules:**
- Biochemistry 315

### 365 (16) Practical protein expression, purification and analysis techniques (3L, 3P)

Molecular biology, recombinant protein expression and protein purification techniques. Analysis of DNA and
protein purity and integrity. Techniques include plasmid DNA isolation, PCR, restriction enzyme digests,
agarose gel electrophoresis, preparation of competent cells, transformation, induction of protein expression,
immobilised-metal affinity chromatography, desalting, protein concentration determinations, SDS-PAGE,
western blot, activity assays and spectrophotometric analyses.

Practicals will be presented during the recess periods, specifically during a) the week before the 2nd
semester officially starts, and b) the recess between the 3rd and 4th terms. By registering for this module



students confirm that they are available during both these periods.

**Prerequisite modules:**
- Biochemistry 315

**Biochemistry as a major for the BSc degree**

The following modules are required: Biochemistry 214(16), 244(16), 315(16), 365(16), Bioinformatics 312(8), and
either Biochemistry 323(8) or Bioinformatics 322(8), and either Biochemistry 345(16) or Applied Chemistry
354(16).

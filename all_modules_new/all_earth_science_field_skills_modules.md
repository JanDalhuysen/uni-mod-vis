## First Year

### 172 (8) Earth Science Field Skills (2P)

Students taking the Earth Science Programme must enrol in this module. The module is composed of field or
practical work, throughout the year, some of which may be scheduled during holidays or on weekends. The
following aspects of Earth Science field skills will be covered: Defining lithological packages, recognizing
map scale; working with topographic and geological maps and aerial photos to record information and to
locate yourself, using GIS platforms to record spatial information; mineralogy, identification of sedimentary,
metamorphic and igneous rocks and structures and their depositional or emplacement significance; practical
consideration of natural environment, measuring the impact of human population on natural environment.

**Corequisite modules:**
- Geo-environmental Science 124, 154

## Second Year

### 272 (16) Earth Science Field Skills (2P)

A compulsory module for students taking the Earth Science Programme. The module is composed of sixteen
days’ or equivalent period of time compulsory field, practical or project work, spread over one year. This
could be on weekends and during term breaks. Field, practical or project work will cover the following
aspects of geological field skills: Defining lithological packages, recognizing map scale; the use of structural
compasses to record structural information and geological map construction; working with topographic
maps and aerial photos whilst in the field to record information and to locate yourself; identification of
sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks and structures in the field and their depositional or
emplacement significance; ore deposit indicators and rock associations; practical consideration of
environmental systems to understand the consequences of anthropogenic activities.

### 279 (16) Foundations of Abstract mathematics I (2L, 2P)

**Take note** : this module will be offered from 2026 as replacement for Mathematics 278(32). Admission is
subject to approval by the Department of Mathematical Sciences.

This module is an introduction to axiomatic mathematics and mathematical exploration. Its goal is to build/
reinforce your skills in composing deductive arguments, analysis of mathematical concepts, exploration of
mathematical ideas, discovery of theorems, and mathematical abstraction, concretisation, creativity and
problem-solving in general. This goal will be achieved through a selection of topics that may vary from year
to year. Such topics could include set theory, number theory, order theory, and study of various basic
mathematical structures.

## Third Year

### 314 (16) Algebra (3L, 3T)

This module is an introduction to the basic axiomatic structures of algebra. These structures provide the
natural surroundings for the discussion of many of the most important results in number theory, algebraic
geometry and computational algebra. Among others, the following are studied: groups, rings, residue classes
modulo n, quotient rings and fields, rings of polynomials, Euclidean domains, unique factorisation domains,
extensions of fields, applications to straight-edge and compass constructions, finite fields and their
applications.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Mathematics 214, 244

### 318 (16) Foundations of Abstract Mathematics II (3P)

**Take note** : this module will be offered from 2027 as replacement for Mathematics 378(32). Admission
subject to approval by the Department of Mathematical Sciences.

This module is an advanced course on axiomatic mathematics and mathematical exploration. Its goal is to
further your skills in composing advanced deductive arguments, analysis of advanced mathematical
concepts, exploration of advanced mathematical ideas, discovery of advanced theorems, and mathematical
abstraction, concretisation, creativity and problem-solving in general. This goal will be achieved through a
selection of advanced topics that may vary from year to year. Such topics could include the study of
mathematical structures arising across algebra and number theory, topology and geometry, functional
analysis, combinatorics, logic and category theory.

### 324 (16) Complex Analysis (3L, 3T)

### 344 (16) Discrete Mathematics (3L, 3T)

Discrete Mathematics, or "Concrete Mathematics", as it is called in a famous book, deals with concrete
objects that are inherently discrete, such as permutations, sets, trees and words. Emphasis will be placed on
enumeration techniques. An introduction to elementary number theory will also be presented. In this part of
the module, classical topics such as Fermat's theorem, Wilson's theorem or Lagrange's theorem on sums of
four squares are treated.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Mathematics 214, 244 or equivalent modules

### 345 (16) Logic (2L, 4T)

Out of the four tutorial periods, two are scheduled tutorials and two are for independent work on



assignments

This module gives an introduction to mathematical logic and formal mathematical languages, with a special
emphasis on those languages that can be used for foundation of mathematics.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Mathematics 114, 144 or equivalent modules

### 365 (16) Real Analysis (3L, 3T)

The aim of this module is to introduce and investigate the concepts, spaces, examples, and results that
provide the foundation for wide-ranging developments in analysis. Typical topics studied are real numbers
and their properties, basic theorems about the real numbers (including the fundamental results about
sequences, functions, sequences of functions, etc.), introduction to metric spaces.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Mathematics 214, 244

### 378 (32) Foundations of Abstract Mathematics II (1L, 3P)

**Take note** : this module will be replaced with Mathematics 318(16) in 2027. Admission subject to approval by
the Department of Mathematical Sciences.

Out of the four tutorial periods, two are scheduled tutorials and two are for independent work on
assignments.

This module continues from Foundations of Abstract Mathematics I, going to higher levels of modern
conceptual mathematics. The module will be chiefly based on group discussions led by the lecturer, and it
involves work on a project in any field of contemporary mathematics selected by the student in consultation
with the Department. This shall give excellent preparation for postgraduate study in mathematics. The
module will be also useful for those who do not intend to carry on with mathematics, as it will enrich them
with the mathematical culture of thinking and logical reasoning.

**Mathematics as a major for the BSc degree**

The following modules are required: Mathematics 114(16), 144(16), 214(16), 244(16), and Mathematics 314(16),
324(16), 365(16) together with one module from Mathematics 344(16), 345(16), or Mathematics 314(16), 324(16),
Financial Mathematics 378(32).

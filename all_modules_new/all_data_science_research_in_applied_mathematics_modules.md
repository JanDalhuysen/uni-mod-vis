# 14736 Data Science Research in Applied Mathematics

## Fourth Year

### 472 (40) Data Science Research Project

The research assignment provides students with a comprehensive learning experience that integrates
knowledge from previous courses. Students will integrate knowledge and experiences gained from all
previous modules and apply this to a data-rich research topic. They will have the opportunity to synthesise
what they have learned and apply that knowledge to new, complex situations. Students should engage in
the entire process of solving a real-world data science problem, from collecting and processing actual data
and applying suitable and appropriate analytical methods to the problem, to communicating the results
clearly and comprehensibly.

**Prerequisite pass modules:**
- Applied Mathematics 314, 354, 364
- Data Science 346
- Mathematical Statistics 312

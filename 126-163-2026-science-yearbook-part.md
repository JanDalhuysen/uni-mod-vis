# **2. Assessment of modules**


Modules are assessed according to the rules stipulated in Stellenbosch University’s Assessment Policy and
the Assessments and Promotion chapter in the SU Yearbook Part 1 (General Rules).

# **3. Prerequisite pass, prerequisite and corequisite modules**


After the description of the module’s content, the prerequisite pass, prerequisite and corequisite modules for
that module are given, where applicable. The following terms are used:


Prerequisite pass module


  - A prerequisite pass module is a module that you must **pass** before you can take the module(s) for
which it is a prerequisite pass module.


Prerequisite module


  - A prerequisite module is a module in which you must obtain a **final mark of at least 40**, before you
can take the module for which it is a prerequisite module.


  - If you have once complied with a prerequisite rule, your compliance will remain valid for the period
given in the applicable assessment rules, even if you repeat the prerequisite module and do not
meet the minimum level when repeating the module.


  - **Take note:** You must pass all the modules you took as prerequisites in the programme before the
relevant degree, certificate or diploma can be awarded to you.


Corequisite module


  - A corequisite module is a module that you must register for in an earlier semester than the module
for which it is a corequisite, or in the same semester.


  - **Take note:** You must pass all the modules you took as corequisites in the programme before the
relevant degree, certificate or diploma can be awarded to you.

### **3.1 Condition for the granting of a qualification or degree**


The Faculty will only award a qualification if you have passed all the relevant prerequisite and corequisite
modules of the specific degree programme.


  - Before making a final selection of elective modules that you want to take in a specific academic
year, consult the relevant class and assessment timetables closely. If any two modules occupy the
same time slot on a particular timetable, or have assessments scheduled at the same time, you
cannot register for both modules because they are an inadmissible combination.


For more information, please consult My.SUN.


  - Also make sure that you meet the prescribed prerequisite pass, prerequisite and corequisite
requirements for each module that you must follow in the prescribed curriculum of your degree

programme.


For more information on these prerequisites, please consult the module contents below.

The study of global change with a biological perspective brings together historical and current evidence for
such changes and summarises its main drivers. Topics include global climate change, anthropogenic drivers
such as pollution, invasion biology, land use and ecosystem change. Data at different spatial and temporal
scales and at different levels of biological organisation are covered (from species to communities and
ecosystems, and from micro to macroscales), highlighting the technologies and numerical techniques used
to study these processes. Examples will have a strong African focus, including case studies from the
Western Cape province from both faunal and floral perspectives. Important areas of teaching include the
relevance of understanding global climate change for African, in particular South African, ecosystems. There
is a strong emphasis on appropriate communication regarding all the above topics, both among scientists
and between scientists and other stakeholders, including the general public.


**315 (16) Ecology Field Course (3L, 3P)**


This is a field-based module. The location of the module will change from year to year. The module will be
timed to fall outside of the formal lecture periods – typically during the last two weeks of January. The aim of
the module is to bring ecological and evolutionary theory to life in the field. The main foci are biotic
interactions (e.g. pollination, competition, facilitation), animal behaviour and ecosystem-level ecology.
Lectures, assignments and discussion groups will be conducted in the field, as well as during the normal
university term.


This module is a restricted module and largely limited to students registered in the Biodiversity and Ecology
programme. Participants may be selected from other programmes based on past performance and available
places.

use of morphological, anatomical, embryological, palynological and molecular characters. The role of
hybridisation and polyploidy in the diversification of the angiosperm lineage is assessed. Specialised
morphological and physiological adaptations to suboptimal environments and the effect of such adaptations
on the diversification of angiosperms are discussed.


The practical series focuses on Fynbos taxa and plant identification up to the family level.


_Prerequisite pass modules: ‒ any two of the following three modules:_

how conservation outcomes may change with changing climates and species responses), conservation
genetics as a tool to support spatial planning and species conservation (including adaptive responses to
environmental stressors), carbon storage and trading and their links to ecological restoration (with a focus on

122


Science


ecology, and policy and legislation to support conservation and management outcomes.


_Global Change 311 is not a prerequisite for Global Change 341 (especially for international students). However, it_
_is highly recommended that students do take Global Change 311, because an understanding of the_
_fundamentals of the drivers of climate change and their impact on biodiversity and well-being (which are_
_covered in Global Change 311) will prepare students for the content of Global Change 341 and provide a stronger_
_footing from which to start. Global Change 341 can be taken independently, if necessary, but this will require_
_additional, independent work by students for them to be able to follow the content of the module._


**342 (16) Integrative Marine Science (3L, 3P)**


This module is presented as five sections that progress from understanding the physical, chemical,
geological and biological nature of marine systems to the utilisation, management and protection of marine
products systems. Exploration of the physical marine environment focusses specifically on ocean climate
and circulation, tides and waves, and coastal and estuarine processes. This is followed by the chemical
section, which examines the properties of seawater, focussing on salinity and dissolved gases. The
geological section considers plate tectonics, marine provinces and marine sediments. The biological section
explores biological life in oceans and adaptations of marine organisms to the different marine environments;
productivity and how this feeds into energy and food webs; and benthic, pelagic, island, estuarine and
mangrove systems. The final section explores the historical and contemporary reliance of humans on the
ocean; consequences of harvesting marine products; the development of marine protected areas and how
this often leads to conflict with people who rely on the ocean for their livelihoods or recreation. Throughout
the module we will explore skills related to understanding and measuring different processes.


**344 (16) Evolutionary Ecology (3L, 3P)**


Topical themes in evolutionary ecology will be covered, namely the evolution of behaviour, biotic
interactions and physiology. This module will deal with the following, as well as related, topics: game theory;
optimal-foraging theory; life history evolution; evolution of sex; sexual selection and sex ratios; altruism and
the evolution of sociality. Evolutionary arms races with mimicry and sexual conflict as examples; coevolution
of plant animal interactions. The link between behaviour and physiology and physiological tolerances and
constraints on survival, life histories and reproductive strategies. Appropriate field and statistical techniques
used in evolutionary ecology research will be covered during practical sessions.

pertinent to the understanding of biodiversity and ecology. By adopting a multi-level approach, the module
focus on the following topics: Time tree of life, evolutionary biogeography, genetic diversity and
differentiation among populations, gene flow, terrestrial and marine phylogeography, reconstruction of a
phylogeny, gene trees/species trees, coalescent, rates of evolution, taxonomy, evolutionary classification,
conservation genetics, molecular ecology, invasion genetics, genome evolution, cytogenetics/chromosomal

# Handle all text files automatically:
# Commit as LF, check out as the OS-native ending (CRLF on Win, LF on Linux)
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly force LF for files that must work on Linux/Mac (like shell scripts)
*.sh text eol=lf

# Explicitly force CRLF for files that must work on Windows (like batch files)
*.bat text eol=crlf
*.cmd text eol=crlf

# Mark true binary files to prevent accidental line-ending changes

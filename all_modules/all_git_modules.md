# 12923 Geographical Information Technology

## First Year

### 141 (16) Nature of Spatial Data (3L, 3P)

This module focuses on the fundamentals of geoinformation science and cartography. The module
introduces spatial awareness for recognizing patterns and relationships among objects on maps; data
collection methods specifically designed for spatial data; data modelling of geographical data as raster or
vector; and spatial thinking to explore and understand problems using data from physical, urban and
environmental geography contexts. This module will focus on cultivating a sense of professional belonging
in future geoinformatics practitioners and geospatial data scientists.

## Second Year

### 211 (16) Earth Observation (3L, 3P)

Principles of remote sensing and earth observation; the electromagnetic spectrum; reflectance
characteristics of various objects on the earth's surface; atmospheric interaction with electromagnetic
energy; digital imagery; image resolution; satellite systems; image enhancement and pre-processing;
unsupervised and supervised image classification; accuracy assessment; GIS integration.

- Mathematics 114 or Mathematics (Bio) 124

### 214 (16) Geographical Information Systems (3L, 3P)

Introductory overview and comprehension of GIS in the context of geo-information science; The nature of

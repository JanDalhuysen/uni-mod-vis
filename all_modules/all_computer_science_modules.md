## First Year

### 113 (16) Computer Science for Actuarial Studies (3L, 3P)

Introduction to computer programming from a financial perspective. Basic financial problems are rephrased
in terms of analytical problem solving. Standard imperative programming constructs including types of
variables, assignments, if-then-else and loops, and recursive approaches are covered as needed in financial
programming. Static data structures (in particular arrays) and declarative programming models such as
spreadsheets are also covered.

**Corequisite modules:**

- Actuarial Science 112
- Mathematics 114

### 114 (16) Introductory Computer Science (3L, 3P)

Introduction to basic computer programming; formulation and solution of problems by means of computer
programming; data representation and variable types (including character strings, integers, floating point
numbers and Boolean variables); assignment statements; conditional execution and iteration; static data
structures (arrays and records); input and output (including graphics and sound); modular programming;
recursion; testing and debugging; introduction to object-oriented programming (including abstraction,
encapsulation and use of existing object implementations).

**Corequisite modules:**

### 144 (16) Introductory Computer Science (3L, 3P)

Further formulation and solution of problems by means of computer programming; introductory data
structures and algorithms in an object-oriented set-up; key concepts in object orientation: inheritance and
polymorphism; design patterns as abstractions for the creation of reusable object-oriented designs;
searching and sorting algorithms; complexity theory for the analysis of algorithms; fundamental methods in
the design of algorithms; dynamic data structures; regular expressions and finite automata.
